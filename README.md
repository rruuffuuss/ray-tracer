# ray-tracer
an attempt at creating a 3d raytracer with only my existing knowledge 

This is a sort of challenge i set myself, I want to try and create 3d graphics without researching how to do it.
I am mainly using my knowledge of 3d graphs, modelling rays as lines and polygons out of planes.

Very early stage
